The information we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy. The app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

This Service does not use these “temporary files” explicitly.

If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of this Service.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The motive is to carry out the tasks assigned to them on our behalf.
